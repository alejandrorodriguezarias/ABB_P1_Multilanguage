\section{Introduction}

This document is meant to display the work made on implementing the same data structure, a binary search tree, and associated algorithms in an array of assorted programming languages.

\section{Language: C}

\begin{description}[align=left,labelwidth=10em]
\item [Compiler] GCC 5.4.0
\item [Operating System] Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS 64 bits
\end{description}

C is an imperative procedural programming language that supports structured programming and recursion. C has a weak and static typing and provides a low-level access to memory, allowing us to make a dinamic and manual memory management. C gives us a lot of control flow tools for our problem:

\begin{itemize}  
\item Executing a set of statements only if some condition is met (\texttt{if-else}).
\item Executing a set of statements zero or more times, until some condition is met (\texttt{while(condition)}). 
\item Allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values in order to choose an execution branch (\texttt{switch-case}).
\item Executing a set of distant statements, after which the flow of control usually returns (subroutines).
\end{itemize}

The C library \texttt{stdlib} provides us  functions to make a manual memory management of the dinamic memory. In our problem we use two of that functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \texttt{malloc(size)} function allocates `size' bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
\item The \texttt{free} function frees the memory space pointed by the pointer.
\end{itemize}
	
For the data structure we use \texttt{struct}. A user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds. Structures are used to represent a record. 

\subsection*{Memory Management}

The main differences when it comes to adapt Pascal code to C code are Pascal abstractions in memory management and reference parameters, since C has a lower level memory management. To inicialize a pointer in Pascal is enough to call the \texttt{new} function with the pointer as a parameter, but in order to initialize a pointer in C setting the pointer to the returned value of the \texttt{malloc} function is needed. The \texttt{malloc} function requires the size of the pointer in bytes to allocate the memory.

\subsection*{Differences within reference parameters}

Pascal has a \texttt{VAR} keyword to pass arguments by reference but in C language every argument is passed by value, so passing a pointer to the memory address of the argument is needed in order to modify it.

\subsection*{Unit in C}

C needs two files to make a library: a code file (.c) and a header file (.h). The header file provides a program with library functions.
Pascal has the header and source code in the same file.

\section{Language: Java}
\section{Language: Ruby}

\begin{description}[align=left,labelwidth=10em]
\item [Language Version] Ruby 2.4.2
\item [Interpreter] IRB (Interactive Ruby Shell) 0.9.6
\item [Operating System] MS Windows 10 Education 64 bits
\end{description}

Ruby is an scripting, imperative, reflective, object-oriented programming language with strong and dynamic typing. Dynamic memory management is automatic. Ruby give us a lot of control flow tools for our problem:

\begin{itemize}  
\item Executing a set of statements only if some condition is met (\texttt{if-else}).
\item Executing a set of statements zero or more times, until some condition is met (\texttt{while(condition)}). 
\item Allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values in order to choose an execution branch (\texttt{switch-case}).
\item Executing a set of distant statements, after which the flow of control usually returns (subroutines).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Memory Management}

Ruby dynamic memory management is done with an automatic garbage colector that frees allocated memory when it's unused. For the data structure we use a constant \texttt{Struct} with the necessary fields for our problem. All structures on our code are created by that constant struct.

In Ruby, type data declarations aren't done in compiling time: they are assigned during run time so we don't need to create any type in order to solve our problem (excluding \texttt{tNodeT struct}).

\subsection*{Differences within reference parameters}

Pascal has a \texttt{VAR} keyword to pass arguments by reference but in Ruby `pass by object reference' is used:

 \begin{itemize}
\item Inside the function, any of the object's members can have new values assigned to them and these changes will persist after the function returns.
\item Inside the function, assigning a whole new object to the variable causes the variable to stop referencing the old object. But after the function returns, the original variable will still reference the old object.
\end{itemize}

	Therefore Ruby functions return the modified input parameter so setting the input argument on the new function in order to update it correctly is needed.
	We have to do it that way because when the input argument is an empty tree we need to reassign it to a new node. This logic is maintained in the whole code.
	
\subsection*{Diferences within the recursive remove function}

In the recursive remove function a nested function is declared, but Ruby doesn't allow nested function so it can't use the local variables of the function that contains it. We have to pass a variable called aux as an input parameter. Besides a reference to the node is passed as an input parameter in order to avoid losing the original node reference, since aux is being changed to always be the father of the leaf node and so the value of its child (leaf node) is changed into \texttt{null}.
 
\subsection*{Improvement}

Ruby's module is a class that can't be instaced or have instance methods which complicates the management of the nodes. If we use a class instantiable for the management of nodes it would be easy to modify the values with getters and setters, simplifying the program logic.
